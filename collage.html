    This project is the culmunation of technology in our daily lives. It looks like that of both people and technology hand in hand with the appearance of binary code, people using technology, and a subtle pop culture reference to the matrix. This makes the piece feel as if technology has morphed with reality potraying the idea that technology has become one, and even taken over our lives. This idea was motivated by the obvious observation that humans have become reliant on technology in their daily lives with everyone on their smartphones ever waking moment of the day. It should be taken from this context of technology in our reality, and experienced by people passively as they reflect on what it may imply about society.
